title: A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
---

## Summary

Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.

## Description 

Components like libraries, frameworks and other modules have the same privileges as the application. Some components have known vulnerabilities, which may leave applications open to malicious attacks. You can be vulnerable to these types of attacks if components in an application are out of date or unsuppoted. Scanning for vulnerabilities regularly, upgrading the underlying platforms and testing the compatibility of upgraded, updated libraries can help avoid you being vulnerable.
