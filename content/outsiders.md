## Plot
In 1960s Tulsa, Oklahoma, greasers Ponyboy Curtis and his brothers, Darry, and Soda, as well as Johnny Cade, "Dally", "Two-Bit", and Steve Randle hang out. Their rivals are the socs, wealthier kids from the other side of town. The Curtis brothers live together, with Darry taking on a parental role because their parents died in an accident.

While Ponyboy is walking home some socs beat him up. Greasers show up and rescue him. One night, Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally go to a drive-in, where Dally unsuccessfully hits on "Cherry". After Dally leaves, Cherry and her friend Marcia invite Ponyboy and Johnny to sit with them. Later, the boys walk the girls home when their boyfriends, Bob Sheldon and Randy Anderson, confront them. Johnny recognizes Bob as a soc who beat him up. The girls defuse the situation by going home with the socs.

When Ponyboy arrives home, Darry yells at and hits him, causing Ponyboy to run away. Ponyboy fetches Johnny and goes to a park. They are confronted by Bob and Randy, and three other socs, who chase and attack them. They beat up Johnny and try to drown Ponyboy in a fountain. Ponyboy passes out, and when he comes to, he sees Johnny holding a blood-stained switchblade and muttering about killing Bob, whose body is nearby, and whose friends have fled.

Ponyboy and Johnny go see Dally, who advises them to go to Windrixville to lay low. Johnny and Ponyboy hop onto a cargo train and take refuge in an abandoned church. They cut their hair and Ponyboy bleaches his. To pass time, the boys play poker and read. After a few days, Dally arrives with news that Cherry has offered to support the boys in court, and that he told the police that Johnny and Pony were in Texas. He gives Ponyboy a note from Sodapop, asking Ponyboy to come home. Johnny says they have to turn themselves in, but Dally disagrees. When the boys return to the church, they find the building on fire, with children trapped inside. They rescue the kids but Johnny suffers a broken back and severe burns. Ponyboy reunites with his brothers. Johnny is charged with manslaughter for killing Bob, while Ponyboy may be sent to a boys' home.

Bob's death sparks calls from the socs for a rumble. On the day of the rumble, Randy tells Ponyboy he wants no part of it. Later on, Ponyboy and Two-Bit visit Johnny in the hospital. Cherry visits Ponyboy to talk about court. She tells him she does not want to visit Johnny at the hospital because he killed Bob. Later that night the Greasers win the rumble. Afterwards, Dally drives an injured Ponyboy to the hospital to visit Johnny. They enter Johnny's hospital room to tell him about the Greasers' victory, but he is unimpressed and dies after telling Ponyboy to "stay gold".

Unable to bear Johnny's death, Dally wanders through the hospital. He robs a grocery store, but is shot and wounded by the owner. Pursued by the police, Dally is surrounded and killed by the police when he points his empty gun at them.

Everyone goes to court for Bob's murder and the judge finds Ponyboy not guilty. After court, Cherry sees Ponyboy at school and ignores him. During an argument between Darry and Ponyboy, Sodapop flees as they follow him. They stop as Sodapop says they can't live like that anymore and have to start to get along which they agree on. Later, Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny saying that saving the children was worth sacrificing his own life.

## Development

Francis Ford Coppola had not intended to make a film about teen angst until Jo Ellen Misakian, a school librarian from Lone Star Elementary School in Fresno, California, wrote to him on behalf of her seventh and eighth grade students about adapting The Outsiders.

## Casting

The casting process led to debut or star-making performances of actors who would be collectively referred to throughout the 80s as the Brat Pack: C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise.Mickey Rourke, Scott Baio, and Dennis Quaid also auditioned for roles but were not cast. Producer Fred Roos, a frequent collaborator with Coppola, was partially responsible for the film's casting. In particular, he scouted Patrick Swayze based on his performance in the roller skating movie Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979).

Ralph Macchio stated that during auditions, Coppola "wanted everybody to read for a different role." He said that Coppola had all of the actors "in one room watching each other audition...It’s brutal because you’re becoming self-conscious of any choices because you’re watching reactions based on other actors and watching the filmmakers and how they respond because you’re all trying to get the job. For Francis, it was about mixing and matching the ensemble, saying 'Dennis Quaid, you read this, and Rob Lowe, you read that.' As a New Yorker who didn't know any of the other actors auditioning, Macchio also stated that he felt like an outsider during the process.
