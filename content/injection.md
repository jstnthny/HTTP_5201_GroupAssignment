## description 
Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

## Summary
Any type of data can be an injection vector, environment variables, parameters, external and internal web services, and all types of users. Injection vulnerabilities are often found in SQL, LDAP, XPath, or NoSQL queries, OS commands, XML parsers, SMTP headers, expression languages, and ORM queries. It can be resulted in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access. It can be prevented by keeping data separate from commands and queries.
